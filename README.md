# [Project 3: U.S. Oil & Gas Development Clustering](https://github.com/jordanjpappas/Oil_Gas_Cluster_Analysis)
“Stylized Trends in 21st Century US Onshore Oil and Gas Drilling Geography from Cluster Analysis.”
<br /> • Study geographic development of oil and gas industry across US using cluster finite mixture models fit tocounty-level time series data.
<br /> • Imported natural gas data in CSV format containing 1 million rows. Write R scripts to clean data usingpackages like dplyr, reshape2, tidyverse.
<br /> • Apply machine learning algorithms such as finite mixture and clustering models using FlexMix package.
<br /> • Prepare research paper for publication using ggplot2, LaTeX.

# [Project 5: U.S. Drug-Related Disorders Data Visualization](https://github.com/jordanjpappas/Opioid_Dynamics)
“Dynamics in drug-related disorders from 1999-2018 in the U.S.”
<br /> • Examine drug abuse in non-drug overdose deaths in US mortality database from 1999 – 2018.
<br /> • Collected CDC mortality dataset in RDS format containing 200,000 rows. Cleaned in R using packageslike dplyr, reshape2, tidyverse.
<br /> • Estimate from data analysis suggests severity of drug abuse in non-drug overdoses from 1999 to 2018was 20% higher than current estimates.
<br /> • Prepare research paper for publication using ggplot2, LaTeX.
